#### **In this Case study, I apply these function and combine them to retrieve / process data**

1. Basic `SELECT` , `Group by`,  `JOIN` function.
2. Use `CTE` and `nest query` to process more complex query.
3. Use `CASE WHEN` to add column to address question.
4. Use `extract` and `date_trunc` to get the desire part from datetime type
5. `COALESCE` / `nullif` to address null value
6. `Window functions` `sum()` and `lead()`
